## 🔬 Current Focus

- 🏒 [**NHL Data Visualization & Modeling Web App**](https://github.com/DuncanC04/NHL-APP)  
  → Full-stack application using **PostgreSQL**, **Node.js**, **Python APIs**, and **TailwindCSS**  
  → Visualizes and models NHL data with interactive dashboards and predictive tools  
  → Deployed via Docker for portable, containerized infrastructure

- 🔋 **Battery Health Modeling** @ National Institute for Undersea Vehicle Technology  
  →	Data Collection & Visualization: Conducted 310 tests on lithium-ion battery cells across   
  controlled states of health, charge, and internal short resistance.   
  → Visualization: Displayed results using Power BI, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze effects and trends.    
  →	Machine Learning Modeling & Analysis: Built and evaluated ML models to predict short circuit status and Ohm resistance.     
  Achieved up to 100% accuracy in short circuit classification and an RMSE of 8.84 ohms in resistance regression.
